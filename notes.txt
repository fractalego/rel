1) The execution time is proportional to the number of rules. Make rules parallel at model.py level
2) You should execute train_a_single_path() one epoch at a time, so that you can stop when the best index matches

The problem here is that the paths and rules are being trained at the same time. There is no way to save
the original vectors and start from there. How do you save old copies of pytorch vectors?
