* 20dim embeddings seem to be too low for ~60 relations.

* unconnected graphs seem to confuse the system. actually, every graph bigger than the match seem to confuse the system.
  The edges are trained correctly though. Maybe if the edges could sort of attach to the target and break the symmetry it would work.
